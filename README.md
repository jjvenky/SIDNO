Stable Isotopes of Dissolved Nitrous Oxide
------------------------------------------

Model file associated with Thuss SJ, Venkiteswaran JJ, and Schiff SL. 2014. Proper interpretation of dissolved nitrous oxide isotopes, production pathways, and emissions requires a modelling approach. PLoS ONE 9(3): e90641. doi: [10.1371/journal.pone.0090641](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0090641).

In this manuscript, we present a dynamic model of the stable isotopic composition of both the dissolved and emitted N<sub>2</sub>O in aqueous systems. We apply this model to two different measured diel patterns of the isotopic ratios of N<sub>2</sub>O in an aquatic ecosystem. We use the model to elucidate the relationship between the isotopic ratios of source, dissolved, and emitted N<sub>2</sub>O, to allow for improved interpretation of dissolved N<sub>2</sub>O isotope data. Ultimately, a process-based understanding on N cycling with aquatic ecosystems may be developed based on interpretation of N cycling processes.

The STM file was created with Stella (version 9.1.4 http://www.iseesystems.com) to perform the analyses described in this manuscript.
