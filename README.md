Stable Isotopes of Dissolved Nitrous Oxide
------------------------------------------

Future home of a simple three box model (SIDNO, Stella version 9.0.3, http://www.iseesystems.com) developed to study the relationships between the isotopic ratios of source, dissolved, and emitted N<sub>2</sub>O.

Model file associated with Thuss, Venkiteswaran, and Schiff manuscript titled *Proper interpretation of dissolved nitrous oxide isotopes, production pathways, and emissions requires a modelling approach*.

This manuscript was submitted to *PLOS ONE* as PONE-D-13-29050. STM file to perform the analyses and recreate the figures in the manuscript will be here once the paper is accepted.
