Stable Isotopes of Dissolved Nitrous Oxide
------------------------------------------

Model file associated with Thuss, Venkiteswaran, and Schiff manuscript titled *Proper interpretation of dissolved nitrous oxide isotopes, production pathways, and emissions requires a modelling approach*. This manuscript was accepted by *PLOS ONE* for publication as PONE-D-13-29050 on 2014-02-04.

In this manuscript, we present a dynamic model of the stable isotopic composition of both the dissolved and emitted N<sub>2</sub>O in aqueous systems. We apply this model to two different measured diel patterns of the isotopic ratios of N<sub>2</sub>O in an aquatic ecosystem. We use the model to elucidate the relationship between the isotopic ratios of source, dissolved, and emitted N<sub>2</sub>O, to allow for improved interpretation of dissolved N2O isotope data. Ultimately, a process-based understanding on N cycling with aquatic ecosystems may be developed based on interpretation of N cycling processes.

The STM file was created with Stella (version 9.1.4 http://www.iseesystems.com) to perform the analyses described in this manuscript. A version containing the doi and manuscript citation will be created as version 1.0 once this informatio nis available.
